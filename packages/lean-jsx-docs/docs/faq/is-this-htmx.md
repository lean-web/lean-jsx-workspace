# Is this HTMX?

LeanJSX shares many principles with [HTMLX](https://htmx.org/), specially around binging focus back to HTML -e.g. returning parsed HTML from API requests, instead of data like JSON- and operating as a full stack tool.

However, LeanJSX is focused on allowing React developers to re-use their knowledge and tooling around JSX to build server-rendered web applications, requiring less of a mindset shift.
