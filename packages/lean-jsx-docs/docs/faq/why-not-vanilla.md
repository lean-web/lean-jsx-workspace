# Why not just pure HTML and JavaScript?

Vanilla JavaScript requires a considerable amount of code to setup any kind of dynamic behavior: Get DOM references, create event listeners for buttons, etc; all in a context external to the referenced HTML elements.

LeanJSX takes advantage of the collocation of HTML and JavaScript and abstracts away all the setup needed to connect action handlers with elements.
