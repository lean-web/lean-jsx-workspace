# Principles

The LeanJSX project was created due the following principles and ideas:

- **Back to basics**. HTTP and HTML have been around for a long time, and a lot of time, effort and money as gone into optimizing the default HTML+JS+CSS vanilla stack. The old limitations that drove the creationg of JavaScript frameworks are not as rigid as years ago, and nowdays is possible to create great web applications with pure HTML and MPA (Multi-Page Applications).
- **Performance and simplicity**. Drop features that not all web applications need and focus on providing great user experiences with the lowest possible footprint.
- **Focus on development ergonomics**: Take the best parts of traditional MPAs and build them with modern web development tools and patterns.
- **Keep a narrow scope**: Instead of building a framework that tries to solve every problem in web development, build a focused tool that supports multiple patterns.
